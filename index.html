    <h1>My Cat Roger</h1>

    <p>Hello everyone. This is my cat Roger. He was given to my by a close family friend last April. Having a cat is awesome. They are kind of like people in a funny way. <br>Roger is a great cat, he has a really relaxed personality and he loves to play. He does all kinds of adorable things like trying to drink water from the faucet, <br>rolling around on the floor when he wants attention, and running around at 4 in the morning every day for some god damned reason.  </p>
<p>Although Roger wakes me up early in the morning <br> and has scratched the leather off every arm rest in my apartment, <br> he is still a pretty cool cat. Maybe even the best. 
 </p>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read and learn about my cat. <br> I hope he is as cute to you as he is to me <br> and that the picture of him brings you as much joy as it does to me.
